         <h2>If I were to describe myself in a
          sound-byte, this is it: <b>I’m a third culture kid</b>.</h2> 
          <p><em>If you have time for more, here’s the full story.</em> <br><br>
            I'm a Canadian of Pakistani origins, who grew up in Oman and attended an international school with 70 different nationalities. The breadth of my global perspective is reflected in the diversity of my high school pursuits — I graduated from the International Baccalaureate (IB) majoring in Art, Math and English. I organized the nations first TEDxYouth event, and lead a club that educated and empowered women in Tanzania by teaching them English.

From a very young age, I’ve had a deep desire to make a difference in the world by helping underprivileged communities. My conscience is complimented by my strong work ethic — discipline, trustworthiness, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. In my highly intensive Double Degree program, I’m challenged daily to explore the possibilities of marketing, design, and behavioural engineering to deliver products that meet ethical goals.
<br><br>
In my very first semester, I’ve won three case competitions sponsored by companies such as Microsoft and Foresters Financial and have been hired as the Director of Marketing and External Affairs for the Double Degree Club.
