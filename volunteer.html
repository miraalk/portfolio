            <h3>This was evident 5 years ago, when I was privileged to take a school trip to Tanzania. Visiting a village elementary school and helping build a classroom and toilets for the local students was certainly the most rewarding experience of my life. Despite the fact that I could not communicate with them,  it was our smiles and laughter, and the happiness we brought each other that highlighted the power of human relationships to me. 
<br><br>Three years later after thorough planning and organizing I partnered with the Dare Women's Foundation in Tanzania in order to found a club which teaches Tanzanian women English in order to support them within their households, but to also educate the Tanzanian youth in English. I did not let several technical and cultural barriers prevent me supporting the relationships I had formed in Tanzania. In moments of hardship, I referred back to the values I treasured and reminded myself that impacting each other’s lives and making each other better people is exactly what humans are meant to do.
