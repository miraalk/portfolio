            <h3>This was evident 5 years ago, when I was privileged to take a school trip to Tanzania. Visiting a village elementary school and helping build a classroom and toilets for the local students was certainly the most rewarding experience of my life. Despite the fact that I could not communicate with them,  it was our smiles and laughter, and the happiness we brought each other that highlighted the power of human relationships to me. 
<br><br>Three years later after thorough planning and organizing I partnered with the Dare Women's Foundation in Tanzania in order to found a club which teaches Tanzanian women English in order to support them within their households, but to also educate the Tanzanian youth in English. I did not let several technical and cultural barriers prevent me supporting the relationships I had formed in Tanzania. In moments of hardship, I referred back to the values I treasured and reminded myself that impacting each other’s lives and making each other better people is exactly what humans are meant to do.

           <h5>The Proposal I Presented</h5> 
           <p>I would like to start a club at ABA in partnership with the Dare Women’s Foundation in Tanzania. The Dare Women’s Foundation is a Tanzanian NGO which empowers women to become strong leaders through feminine hygiene care, entrepreneurship, nutrition education and conservation. The founder of the foundation is Maggie Simbeye Duncan, more commonly referred to as Mama Maggie. She is one of the safari tour guides for ABA students on their annual Tanzania trip and recently came to ABA for Tanzania week.

            <h5>The Need</h5>
           <p>At the beginning of the year, I reached out to Ms. Burns with the suggestion of starting a club at ABA which helps teach English to the students at Loiber Sirett School, the school that ABA students visit on their annual Tanzania trip. However, we were presented with many different hurdles to do with technology and internet issues. We finally came up with a solution which would only involved teaching a few high school students and not the primary students. Although we were happy with this idea, we found that it was not reaching as many students as we would have liked.

           <h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>
           <p> Ms. Burns suggested that I talk to Mama Maggie when she visited ABA. We had a wonderful discussion and discussed the following points. 
             <ul style = "font-family: Raleway;">
                <li>Mama Maggie thought that the idea of teaching students English is wonderful as it opens so many opportunities for them.</li>
                <li>There are definitely technological issues involved as the Loiber Sirett school has not internet, just like most village schools</li>
             </ul>
           <p>Mama Maggie feels that through her foundation, we can make our dream a reality</p>
             <ul style = "font-family: Raleway;">
                <li>She already has a group of women who come 6 times a week to learn English</li>
                <li>The women are also part of a WhatsApp group in which they communicate in English</li>
             </ul>
           <p>After having discussed my idea with them, they are willing to learn English and then go to schools and teach it to students for free, as long as Mama Maggie covers their transportation for them (which she can)</p>
​
           <h3><b>Benefits of this idea</b></h3>  
            <ul style = "font-family: Raleway;">
              <li>This idea can definitely grow and is not only limited to the students in Loiber Sirett</li>
              <li>The women can go teach students in different villages</li>
              <li>There is no longer the problem of technology as the Dare Women's Foundation usually has full access to wifi </li>
           </ul>

           <h3><b>What are we going to do</b></h3>
            <ul style


Start a club in which we meet once a week after school and WhatsApp video call with the women in Mama Maggie’s English Club

Talking with them will allow them to practice their English skills and will allow us to correct them and help the improve

Join their English Club WhatsApp group so we can gently correct their writing mistakes as well

Teach them new words and vocabulary that will be helpful to them



​

Future Projections

By having a solid base of educating women in Tanzania, this club could benefit students outside of Loiber Sirett School.
